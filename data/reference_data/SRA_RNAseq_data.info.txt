Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	227321	Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4		The transcriptome of Aspergillus nidulans under different growth conditions.  Also, 5'-specific sequencing of the A. nidulans transcriptome.	Background The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been a tractable model organism for cell biology and genetics for over 60 years.  It is among a large number of Aspergilli whose genomes have been sequenced since 2005, including medically and industrially important species.  In order to advance our knowledge of its biology and increase its utility as a genetic model by improving gene annotation we sequenced the transcriptome of A. nidulans with a focus on 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ end analysis.  Results Strand-specific whole transcriptome sequencing showed that 80-95% of annotated genes appear to be expressed across the conditions tested.  We estimate that the total gene number should be increased by approximately 1000, to 11,800.  8.3% of genes had multiple alternative transcripts, but alternative splicing by exon-skipping was very rare.  75% of annotated genes showed some level of antisense transcription and for one gene, meaB, we demonstrated the antisense transcript has a regulatory role. Specific sequencing of the 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ends of transcripts was used for genome wide mapping of transcription start sites, allowing us to interrogate over 7000 promoters and 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ untranslated regions.  Conclusions Our data has revealed the complexity of the A. nidulans transcriptome and contributed to improved genome annotation.  The data can be viewed on the AspGD genome browser.

We estimate that the total gene number should be increased by approximately 1000, to 11,800.  8.3% of genes had multiple alternative transcripts, but alternative splicing by exon-skipping was very rare.  75% of annotated genes showed some level of antisense transcription and for one gene, meaB, we demonstrated the antisense transcript has a regulatory role. Specific sequencing of the 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ends of transcripts was used for genome wide mapping of transcription start sites, allowing us to interrogate over 7000 promoters and 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ untranslated regions.  Conclusions Our data has revealed the complexity of the A. nidulans transcriptome and contributed to improved genome annotation.  The data can be viewed on the AspGD genome browser.

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	227321	Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4		The transcriptome of Aspergillus nidulans under different growth conditions.  Also, 5'-specific sequencing of the A. nidulans transcriptome.	Background The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans has been a tractable model organism for cell biology and genetics for over 60 years.  It is among a large number of Aspergilli whose genomes have been sequenced since 2005, including medically and industrially important species.  In order to advance our knowledge of its biology and increase its utility as a genetic model by improving gene annotation we sequenced the transcriptome of A. nidulans with a focus on 5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ end analysis.  Results Strand-specific whole transcriptome sequencing showed that 80-95% of annotated genes appear to be expressed across the conditions tested.  We estimate that the total gene number should be increased by approximately 1000, to 11,800.  8.3% of genes had multiple alternative transcripts, but alternative splicing by exon-skipping was very rare.  75% of annotated genes showed some level of antisense transcription and for one gene, meaB, we demonstrated the antisense transcript has a regulatory role.

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	162425	Aspergillus nidulans	wild type	KdmA, a histone H3 demethylase with bipartite function, differentially regulates primary and secondary in Aspergillus nidulans metabolism	A. nidulans kdmA encodes a member of the KDM4 family of jumonji histone demethylase proteins, highly similar to metazoan orthologues both within functional domains and in domain architecture. This family of proteins exhibits demethylase activity toward lysines 9 and 36 of histone H3 and plays a prominent role in gene expression and chromosome structure in many species. Mass spectrometry mapping of A. nidulans histones revealed that around 3% of bulk histone H3 carried trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) but more than 90% of histones carried either H3K36me2 or H3K36me3. KdmA functions as H3K36me3 demethylase and has roles in transcriptional regulation. Genetic manipulation of KdmA levels is tolerated without obvious effect in most conditions, but strong phenotypes are evident under various conditions of stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in submerged early and late cultures Ã¢â‚¬â€œ between 25% and 30% of the genome is under KdmA influence, respectively. Transcriptional imbalance in the kdmA deletion mutant may contribute to the lethal phenotype observed upon exposure of mutant cells to low-density visible light on solid medium. While KdmA acts as transcriptional co-repressor of primary metabolism (PM) genes it is required for full expression of several genes involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (SM). Overall design: Two strains, wild type and kdmA deletion, at two conditions, growth at primary (17h) and secondary (48h), were analyzed. Each sample was replicated.

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	162425	Aspergillus nidulans	kdmB	Genome-Wide Transcriptome and Chromatin Analysis of Aspergillus nidulans Primary and Secondary Metabolism Reveals Crucial Function for a Kdm5-Family Histone Demethylase.	Histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) are involved in regulating the synthesis of fungal bioactive compounds. The exact molecular mechanisms of the silencing/activation of secondary metabolism (SM) clusters by these epigenetic events however are not yet fully understood. This work applies a combined approach of quantitative mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the chromatin landscape in two metabolic states: primary and secondary metabolism. Furthermore, to link the particular chromatin states to the expression of condition specific genes, genome wide transcriptome (RNA-seq) was performed. Strikingly, we found that silent A. nidulans SM clusters are free of repressive H3K9me3 though this heterochromatic mark forms distinguished peaks flanking the many SM clusters. In addition, silent SM clusters do not contain detectable levels of activating histone marks such as H3K4me3, H3K36me3 or H3Ac, which, to some extent, are established upon activation of the clusters. In order to investigate the function of dynamic H3K4 methylation/demethylation in transcription, we characterized the KdmB- Jarid1 family histone demethylase. The in vitro assay using heterologously expressed KdmB showed that it is an active demethylase; moreover, MS/MS as well ChIP-seq approaches revealed that it targets H3K4me3 in vivo mediating transcriptional repression. KdmB positively regulates the expression of 40% of A. nidulans SM genes and this function appears to be independent of its demethylase activity. Our bioinformatics approach revealed two states of H3K4me3 in A. nidulans genome: loci with low levels of this mark are more disposed to differential expression in response to environmental clues, while the genes marked by high H3K4me3 levels are constitutively transcribed in our experimental conditions. Taken together our data reveal important role of H3K4 methylation/demethylation in transcription regulation. Furthermore, this study presents the first genome-wide map of H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3 and H3Ac in A. nidulans in different metabolic conditions.

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	162425	Aspergillus nidulans		Genome-wide analyses for the WOPR regulator osaA and the velvet regulator veA	Orchestration of cellular growth and development occurs during the life cycle of Aspergillus nidulans. A multi-copy genetic screen intended to unveil novel regulators of development identified the AN6578 locus predicted to encode a protein with the WOPR domain, which is a broadly present fungi-specific DNA-binding motif. Multi-copy of AN6578 disrupted the normal life cycle of the fungus leading to enhanced proliferation of vegetative cells, whereas the deletion resulted in hyper-active sexual fruiting with reduced asexual development (conidiation), thus named as osaA (Orchestrator of Sex and Asex). Further genetic studies indicate that OsaA balances development mainly by repressing sexual development downstream of the velvet regulator VeA. The absence of osaA is sufficient to suppress the veA1 allele leading to the sporulation levels comparable to veA+ wild type (WT). Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of WT, veA1, and ?osaA veA1 strains by RNA-Seq further corroborate that OsaA functions in repressing sexual development downstream of VeA. However, OsaA also plays additional roles in controlling development, as the ?osaA veA1 mutant exhibits precocious and enhanced formation of HÃƒÂ¼lle cells compared to WT. The OsaA orthologue of Aspergillus flavus is able to complement the osaA null phenotype in A. nidulans, suggesting a conserved role of this group of WOPR domain proteins. In summary, OsaA is an upstream orchestrator of morphological and chemical development in Aspergillus that functions downstream of VeA. Overall design: Examining the transcriptomic profiles of three Aspergillus nidualns strains: FGSC4, FGSC26, and ?osaA veA1. Samples were collected at 12 h post developmental induction.

Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of WT, veA1, and ?osaA veA1 strains by RNA-Seq further corroborate that OsaA functions in repressing sexual development downstream of VeA. However, OsaA also plays additional roles in controlling development, as the ?osaA veA1 mutant exhibits precocious and enhanced formation of HÃƒÂ¼lle cells compared to WT. The OsaA orthologue of Aspergillus flavus is able to complement the osaA null phenotype in A. nidulans, suggesting a conserved role of this group of WOPR domain proteins. In summary, OsaA is an upstream orchestrator of morphological and chemical development in Aspergillus that functions downstream of VeA. Overall design: Examining the transcriptomic profiles of three Aspergillus nidualns strains: FGSC4, FGSC26, and ?osaA veA1. Samples were collected at 12 h post developmental induction. Samples were collected in triplictaes.		PAIRED -	Three biological replicates were analyzed for each strain. All strains were cultured in agitating liquid-submerged medium (vegetative growth) for 18 h, and then shifted to an air-exposed medium to induce development. All samples were collected at time point 12 h following developmental induction, total RNA was extracted usiing TRIzol kit, then submitted for library preparation and sequencing. Strand specific library was prepared from total RNA using Illumina TruSeq Strand specific RNA sample preparation system. Briefly, mRNA was extracted from total RNA using polyA selection, followed by RNA fragmentation. Strand specific library was constructed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using random primers, followed by sample cleanup and the second-strand synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. A single 'A' base was added to the cDNA fragments followed by ligation of the adapters. Final cDNA library was obtained by further purification and enrichment with PCR, and the quality was checked using Bioanalyzer 2100. The library was sequenced (PE100bp) using the Illumina HiSeq2500, with final of over 10 million high quality reads per sample.		cDNA	RNA-Seq	Illumina HiSeq 2500	0		GEO	2015-08-26	GEO	SRS1044155	PRJNA293709	SAMN04009464	SRR2180256
Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	162425	Aspergillus nidulans		Genome-wide analyses for the WOPR regulator osaA and the velvet regulator veA	Orchestration of cellular growth and development occurs during the life cycle of Aspergillus nidulans. A multi-copy genetic screen intended to unveil novel regulators of development identified the AN6578 locus predicted to encode a protein with the WOPR domain, which is a broadly present fungi-specific DNA-binding motif. Multi-copy of AN6578 disrupted the normal life cycle of the fungus leading to enhanced proliferation of vegetative cells, whereas the deletion resulted in hyper-active sexual fruiting with reduced asexual development (conidiation), thus named as osaA (Orchestrator of Sex and Asex). Further genetic studies indicate that OsaA balances development mainly by repressing sexual development downstream of the velvet regulator VeA. The absence of osaA is sufficient to suppress the veA1 allele leading to the sporulation levels comparable to veA+ wild type (WT).

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4				Deletion of the celA gene in Aspergillus nidulans triggers overexpression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes	The cell wall is a structure involved in important stages of fungal growth and morphogenesis. Several studies in the literature have shown how perturbations at the cell wall-level trigger dramatic effects on growth (e.g. Horiuchi, 2009). Despite the importance of fungal cell walls and despite the great advances made in the field, there are still missing pieces in our understanding of cell wall dynamics in filamentous fungi. Some cell wall biosynthetic genes, for example, are still uncharacterized (for a detailed inventory of Aspergillus nidulans cell wall-related genes, see de Groot et al., 2009). The chief polysaccharides in the cell wall of the model organism A. nidulans are ÃƒÅ¸-glucans (ÃƒÅ¸-1,3-, ÃƒÅ¸-(1,3;1,4)- and ÃƒÅ¸-1,6-glucans), chitin and a-1,3-glucans. While much is known about the chitin and a-1,3-glucan biosynthetic genes in A. nidulans (Horiuchi et al., 1999; Fujiwara et al., 2000; Ichinomiya et al., 2002 and 2005; Takeshita et al., 2006; Yoshimi et al., 2013), no characterization is yet available for the celA gene (ANIA_08444) encoding a putative mixed-linkage glucan synthase (de Groot et al., 2009). Recently, a study on A. fumigatus has characterized Tft1, an enzyme shown to be responsible for the production of ÃƒÅ¸-(1,3;1,4)-glucans in this organism (Samar et al., 2015). Deletion of Tft1 causes no obvious phenotype in A. fumigatus and a modest increase in virulence. To characterize the role of ÃƒÅ¸-(1,3;1,4)-glucans in the growth and development of filamentous fungi, we here sought to provide transcriptomics data of an A. nidulans strain showing reduced expression of the gene encoding the putative mixed linkage glucan synthase celA. Overall design: RNA-Seq analysis of the control (SAA.111) and downregulated celA- strains of Aspergillus nidulans. Each condition consists of 3 biological replicates.		PAIRED -	Total RNA from mycelia was extracted from 100 mg of finely ground tissue, by using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), coupled with the on-column DNaseI digestion. RNA Integrity was measured using the Agilent bioanalyzer and RNA integrity numbers (RINs) were >7 for all the samples. RNA concentrations were measured using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). One microgram of extracted RNA was retro-transcribed using the ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (NEB) following the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions. Libraries were prepared from 3Ã‚Âµg of total RNA extracted from the mycelium after 3 days of growth at 37Ã‚Â°C with the SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq kit (Clontech). The isolation of mRNAs was performed using the Illumina beads and the TruSeq protocol (Illumina), as described in Behr et al. (2016). The synthesis of cDNA and shearing were performed with ten ng mRNA, according to the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instruction. The enrichment step was carried out using 14 cycles of PCR. The libraries were then checked using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (DNA High sensitivity Kit) to estimate the average fragment size. Library quantification was performed using the KAPA library quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems) and a ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System (Life technologies). The pooled libraries (at a concentration of 20 pM) were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (MiSeq reagent kit V3, 150 cycles) generating 76 base pairs paired-end reads.		cDNA	RNA-Seq	Illumina MiSeq	0		GEO	2017-07-27	GEO	SRS1941850	PRJNA368921	SAMN06273928	SRR5205834

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4				Deletion of the celA gene in Aspergillus nidulans triggers overexpression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes	The cell wall is a structure involved in important stages of fungal growth and morphogenesis. Several studies in the literature have shown how perturbations at the cell wall-level trigger dramatic effects on growth (e.g. Horiuchi, 2009). Despite the importance of fungal cell walls and despite the great advances made in the field, there are still missing pieces in our understanding of cell wall dynamics in filamentous fungi. Some cell wall biosynthetic genes, for example, are still uncharacterized (for a detailed inventory of Aspergillus nidulans cell wall-related genes, see de Groot et al., 2009). The chief polysaccharides in the cell wall of the model organism A. nidulans are ÃƒÅ¸-glucans (ÃƒÅ¸-1,3-, ÃƒÅ¸-(1,3;1,4)- and ÃƒÅ¸-1,6-glucans), chitin and a-1,3-glucans. While much is known about the chitin and a-1,3-glucan biosynthetic genes in A. nidulans (Horiuchi et al., 1999; Fujiwara et al., 2000; Ichinomiya et al., 2002 and 2005; Takeshita et al., 2006; Yoshimi et al., 2013), no characterization is yet available for the celA gene (ANIA_08444) encoding a putative mixed-linkage glucan synthase (de Groot et al., 2009). Recently, a study on A. fumigatus has characterized Tft1, an enzyme shown to be responsible for the production of ÃƒÅ¸-(1,3;1,4)-glucans in this organism (Samar et al., 2015).

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4				Re-routing central metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans	Plant biomass is the most abundant and renewable carbon source for many fungal species. The composition of biomass consists of about 40-45% cellulose, 20-30% hemicellulose, and 15-25% lignin and varies among plant species. In the bio-based industry, Aspergillus species and other fungi are used for the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes to pretreat agricultural waste biomass (e.g. wheat bran). In this study, we aimed to evaluate if it would be possible to create an Aspergillus strain that releases but does not metabolize hexoses from plant biomass. For this purpose, metabolic mutants were generated that were (partially) impaired in glycolysis, by deleting the hexokinase (hxkA) and glucokinase (glkA) genes. To prevent repression of enzyme production due to the accumulation of hexoses, strains were generated in which these mutations were combined with a mutation in creA, encoding the repressor involved in carbon catabolism. Phenotypic analysis revealed that growth of the ?hxkA?glkA mutant was reduced on wheat bran. However, hexoses did not accumulate during growth of the mutants on wheat bran, suggesting that glucose metabolism is re-routed towards alternative carbon catabolic pathways. Deletion of creA combined with blocking glycolysis resulted in an increased expression of pentose catabolic and phosphate pathway genes. This indicates that the reduced ability to use hexoses as carbon sources has resulted in a shift towards the pentose fraction of wheat bran as a major carbon source to support growth. Overall design: This study compares the gene expression of several A. nidulans strains growing on MM + wheat bran.

For this purpose, metabolic mutants were generated that were (partially) impaired in glycolysis, by deleting the hexokinase (hxkA) and glucokinase (glkA) genes. To prevent repression of enzyme production due to the accumulation of hexoses, strains were generated in which these mutations were combined with a mutation in creA, encoding the repressor involved in carbon catabolism. Phenotypic analysis revealed that growth of the ?hxkA?glkA mutant was reduced on wheat bran. However, hexoses did not accumulate during growth of the mutants on wheat bran, suggesting that glucose metabolism is re-routed towards alternative carbon catabolic pathways. Deletion of creA combined with blocking glycolysis resulted in an increased expression of pentose catabolic and phosphate pathway genes. This indicates that the reduced ability to use hexoses as carbon sources has resulted in a shift towards the pentose fraction of wheat bran as a major carbon source to support growth. Overall design: This study compares the gene expression of several A. nidulans strains growing on MM + wheat bran. The different A. nidulans samples (wildtype, ?hxkA?glkA, ?creA, and ?creA?hxkA?glkA) were taken after 2 hours of incubation.

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4	162425	Aspergillus nidulans	TN02A7	Transcriptomic analysis of salt-stress response in Aspergillus nidulans	Adaptation to changes in the environment is crucial for the viability of all organisms. Although the importance of calcineurin in the stress response has been highlighted in filamentous fungi, little is known about the involvement of ion-responsive genes and pathways in conferring salt tolerance without calcium signaling. In this study, high-throughput RNA-seq was used to investigate salt stress-induced genes in the parent, ?cnaB, and ?cnaB?cchA strains of Aspergillus nidulans, which differ greatly in their salt adaption under salt stress. In total, 2,884 differentially expressed genes including 1,382 up- and 1,502 down-regulated genes were identi?ed. Secondary transporters, which were up-regulated to a greater extent in ?cnaB?cchA than in the parent or ?cnaB strains, are likely to play important roles in response to salt stress. Furthermore, 36 genes were exclusively up-regulated in the ?cnaB?cchA mutant under salt stress. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that genes involved in transport, heat shock protein binding, and cell division processes were exclusively activated in ?cnaB?cchA. Overall, our findings reveal that secondary transporters and stress-responsive genes may play crucial roles in salt tolerance to bypass the requirement for the CchA-calcineurin pathway, contributing to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that influence fungal salt stress adaption in Aspergillus.

Misexpression of clr-2 is sufficeint for inducer free cellulase secretion in N. crassa, but neither clrB or heterologous clr-2 is sufficient for inducer free cellulase secretion in A. nidulans. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a conserved and essential role in cellulose utilization for the transcription factor clr-2 in filamentous ascomycetes and demonstrates that manipulation of clr-2 expression can be used to control cellulase expression in some species. Overall design: Biological triplicates of liquid culture N. crassa and A. nidulans were harvested at 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, after a switch to media of interest.  Global mRNA abundances from liquid cultures of N. crassa and A. nidulans were measured by sequencing on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and HiSeq2000 platforms.	wildtype	SINGLE -			cDNA	RNA-Seq	Illumina HiSeq 2000	0		GEO	2013-09-05	GEO	SRS390995	PRJNA188657	SAMN01914763	SRR676520

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4			TMY3	Conservation and divergence in the asexual development gene regulatory network across a genus of filamentous fungi [RNA-seq]	Asexual development is fundamental to the ecology and lifestyle of filamentous fungi and can facilitate both plant and human infection. In the filamentous fungal genus Aspergillus, the production of asexual spores is primarily governed by the BrlA-AbaA-WetA central regulatory cascade. The final step in this cascade, which is controlled by the WetA protein, not only governs cellular development (i.e., the morphological differentiation of spores) but also ensures its coupling with chemical development (i.e., the coordinated production and deposition of diverse secondary metabolites, such as aflatoxins, into spores). While the wetA gene is conserved across the genus Aspergillus, the structure and degree of conservation of the BrlA-AbaA-WetA regulatory cascade and the broader wetA gene regulatory network (GRN) remain largely unknown. We carried out comparative transcriptome analyses between wetA null mutant and wild type (WT) asexual spores in three representative species spanning the diversity of the genus Aspergillus: the genetic model A. nidulans, the agricultural pest A. flavus, and the human pathogen A. fumigatus. We discovered that WetA regulates asexual sporulation in all three species via a negative feedback loop that represses BrlA, the cascade's first step. Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments in A. nidulans asexual spores suggest that WetA is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with a novel regulatory element, which we term the WetA Response Element (WRE). Interestingly, the WRE is found completely conserved in the non-coding region upstream of the wetA translation start site of many diverse Aspergillus genomes. In contrast, several global transcriptional regulators, most notably those in the velvet complex (veA, velB, and laeA) known to regulate the coupling between asexual development and production of secondary metabolites, show species-specific regulatory patterns. These results suggest that the BrlA-AbaA-WetA cascade's regulatory role in cellular and chemical development of asexual spores is functionally conserved, but that the WetA-associated GRN has diverged during Aspergillus evolution. This entry is for the RNA-seq data. Overall design: For the A. fumigatus experiments, 3 technical replicates of each genotype (wild type and deletion mutant) were sequenced. For the A. nidulans experiments, 4 technical replicates of each genotype (wild type and deletion mutant) were sequenced.

Aspergillus nidulans	FungiDB-42_AnidulansFGSCA4			FGSC4	Conservation and divergence in the asexual development gene regulatory network across a genus of filamentous fungi [RNA-seq]	Asexual development is fundamental to the ecology and lifestyle of filamentous fungi and can facilitate both plant and human infection. In the filamentous fungal genus Aspergillus, the production of asexual spores is primarily governed by the BrlA-AbaA-WetA central regulatory cascade. The final step in this cascade, which is controlled by the WetA protein, not only governs cellular development (i.e., the morphological differentiation of spores) but also ensures its coupling with chemical development (i.e., the coordinated production and deposition of diverse secondary metabolites, such as aflatoxins, into spores). While the wetA gene is conserved across the genus Aspergillus, the structure and degree of conservation of the BrlA-AbaA-WetA regulatory cascade and the broader wetA gene regulatory network (GRN) remain largely unknown. We carried out comparative transcriptome analyses between wetA null mutant and wild type (WT) asexual spores in three representative species spanning the diversity of the genus Aspergillus: the genetic model A. nidulans, the agricultural pest A. flavus, and the human pathogen A. fumigatus. We discovered that WetA regulates asexual sporulation in all three species via a negative feedback loop that represses BrlA, the cascade's first step. Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments in A. nidulans asexual spores suggest that WetA is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with a novel regulatory element, which we term the WetA Response Element (WRE). Interestingly, the WRE is found completely conserved in the non-coding region upstream of the wetA translation start site of many diverse Aspergillus genomes. In contrast, several global transcriptional regulators, most notably those in the velvet complex (veA, velB, and laeA) known to regulate the coupling between asexual development and production of secondary metabolites, show species-specific regulatory patterns. These results suggest that the BrlA-AbaA-WetA cascade's regulatory role in cellular and chemical development of asexual spores is functionally conserved, but that the WetA-associated GRN has diverged during Aspergillus evolution. This entry is for the RNA-seq data. Overall design: For the A. fumigatus experiments, 3 technical replicates of each genotype (wild type and deletion mutant) were sequenced. For the A. nidulans experiments, 4 technical replicates of each genotype (wild type and deletion mutant) were sequenced. The A. nidulans RNA samples were paired-end in nature, making 8 total samples.
